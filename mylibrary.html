    <h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

    <p>In the form below, <b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
    Your search query will search by author, title, or publisher.
    Capitalization is not necessary.
    It's okay to enter partial information, like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

    <p>You can leave the search field empty and only enter dates.
    Regardless, both start and end dates are required for all searches.
    You can use the date fields to limit results, too.
    I added some extra records, which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

    <p><a href="opac.php">OPAC</a></p>

    <p>This is very much a toy, stripped down
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
    The records are basic.
    Not only do they not conform to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
    they don't even conform to something as simple as <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

    <p>I also don't provide options to select different fields, like author, title, or publisher fields.
    Instead the search field below searches all the fields (author, title, publisher) in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

    <p>The key idea is to get a sense of how an OPAC works, though.</p>
